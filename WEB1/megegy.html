            <h2>A little bit about the show</h2>
            <p>South Park is a 1997 American television 2D computer animation series launched in 1997 by Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
                 The TV series was produced by Braniff Productions and South Park Digital Studios,
                  and was distributed by Debmar-Mercury, 
                  Lionsgate Television and 20th Television. 
                  In terms of genre, it is a situational comedy series.
                   The series features the surreal adventures of four lower grade boys 
                   (Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman,
                    and Kenny McCormick) and their families, 
                   as well as other urban residents living in the small town of South Park, Colorado.
                    The show, intended for adult viewers,
                     has become notorious primarily for its satirical and obscene tone, 
                    as well as its frequent portrayal of daily events as well as pop culture and American public figures.</p>
